# python-happy-discbot

Hey! Welcome to happyland, where everyone is constantly happy. This discord bot was created mainly as a side-project to follow along with a tutorial on how to create discord bots. I plan on making another bot with more advanced features sometime in the future.

I recommend trying to program your own discord bot! It's not as hard as I thought it would have been.
